# RandomFast ⚡

AI-generated fasting tracker build with Vercel's V0 tool. Allows users to create and track intermittent fasting with a randomly selected duration.


## About This Project

This is an experiment with AI-assisted coding, fast prototyping, and best practices for integrating AI into the software development process. It provides examples of modular UI components, PWA support, and rapid iteration using Next.js and TypeScript.


## Features

- **AI Coding Experiments** – Example workflows and utilities for AI-assisted development
- **Reusable UI Components** – Custom React components for rapid prototyping
- **PWA Support** – Installable, offline-capable web app
- **Theming & Settings** – Theme provider, dialogs, and user preferences
- **Fast Prototyping Utilities** – Tools for quick iteration and testing
- **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly on all devices


## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router) with TypeScript
- **pnpm** for package management
- **PostCSS** for modern CSS workflows
- **Custom UI components** (no Tailwind)
- **React Context** for state management
- Local storage for data persistence
